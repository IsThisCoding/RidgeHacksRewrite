# A Carpooler

This is my personal rewrite of our (failed) attempt to create a carpooling webapp at RidgeHacks. Very bare bones (at the moment)



- [ ] Review + refactor and project restructuring (I don't need separate files for 30 lines)
- [ ] Make UI + UX not awful
- [ ] View routes on a map
- [ ] Dynamically change routes
- [ ] Add more parameters on route optimization (male to female ratio, max distance, etc.)
